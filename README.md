# Sentiment-analysis-on-IMDB-data

This project classifies IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using a deep learning model based on RNN-LSTM.

Overview

Preprocessed 25,000 labeled reviews (tokenization, sequencing, padding).
Built a multi-layer LSTM model with embedding + dropout.
Trained using Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss.

Model

Embedding → LSTM → Dropout → Dense (Sigmoid)

Results

Achieved high accuracy on IMDB sentiment classification.
Demonstrated LSTM’s ability to capture contextual and sequential word dependencies.
This is the end
